## Test Execution Strategy

### Markers
- `@pytest.mark.integration` - Real API integration tests
- `@pytest.mark.e2e` - End-to-end workflow tests
- `@pytest.mark.stress` - Performance and load tests
- `@pytest.mark.edge` - Edge case and failure tests
- `@pytest.mark.prod` - Production readiness tests
- `@pytest.mark.slow` - Long-running tests

### Environment Requirements
- Real API credentials via environment variables
- Test Google Sheets with appropriate permissions
- Sandbox/test accounts for Etsy and Printify
- Sufficient disk space for image processing
- Network connectivity for API calls

### Success Criteria
- 100% test pass rate across all categories
- Performance benchmarks meet production standards
- All edge cases handled gracefully
- Production readiness certification achieved
- Comprehensive test coverage and documentation

## Test Data Management
- Use randomized test data to avoid conflicts
- Implement proper test isolation and cleanup
- Maintain separate test environments
- Document test data requirements and setup

## Reporting
- Detailed test execution reports
- Performance benchmarking results
- Edge case validation summaries
- Production readiness assessment
- Recommendations for optimization
