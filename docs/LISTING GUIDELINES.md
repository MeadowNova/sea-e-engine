ETSY LISTING AUTOMATION RULES
TITLE OPTIMIZATION RULES:
Length: 120-140 characters (Etsy's sweet spot for visibility)
Structure: Primary Keyword | Secondary Keyword | Tertiary Keyword | Gift/Use Case | Style Descriptor
Front-load high-volume keywords in first 60 characters
Include "Art Print" or "Poster" for wall art products
Add gift context ("Gift", "Decor", "Wall Art") for broader appeal
Use pipe separators (|) for clean readability
Avoid repetition of the same word more than twice
Example Pattern: "[Main Subject] [Style] Art Print | [Theme] [Animal] Poster | [Use Case] Wall Art | [Recipient] Gift | [Style Period] Decor"
TAG OPTIMIZATION RULES:
Exactly 13 tags (use all available slots)
Maximum 20 characters per tag (Etsy's limit)
Tag hierarchy:
Tags 1-3: Primary keywords (highest search volume)
Tags 4-6: Secondary keywords (medium competition)
Tags 7-9: Long-tail keywords (specific, lower competition)
Tags 10-13: Gift/occasion/style tags
Include variations: singular/plural, with/without spaces
Mix broad and specific: "cat art" + "space cat art"
Always include: main subject, style, product type, gift context
No special characters except hyphens and spaces
Research-backed: Use only keywords with verified search volume
KEYWORD RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS:
Primary research sources: Etsy search suggestions, Google Trends, competitor analysis
Validate search volume before including any keyword
Check competition level (avoid oversaturated terms unless high-volume)
Include trending keywords from current year research
Balance evergreen vs trending (70% evergreen, 30% trending)
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION RULES:
Hook in first line (appears in search results)
Include all title keywords naturally in description
Add emotional triggers: "perfect for", "ideal gift", "brings joy"
Specify use cases: wall art, gifts, home decor
Include size/format options available
End with call-to-action: "Order now", "Perfect for your space"
